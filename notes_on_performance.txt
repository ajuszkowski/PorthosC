• Replaced HashSet and ArrayList with much smaller
equivalent data structures that don’t do boxing or have
large backing data structures.
• Stopped using foreach on ArrayLists. There is no
reason to do this it creates an extra object every time,
and one can just use direct indexing.
• Told the ArrayList constructors to start out at size 2
instead of size 10. For the last 10% in performance, use
a free list for some commonly allocated objects.
